				<p>[Verse 1]
				Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
				I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
				She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
				In the shape of an "L" on her forehead</p>

				<p>[Pre-Chorus]
				Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
				Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
				Didn't make sense not to live for fun
				Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
				So much to do, so much to see
				So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
				You'll never know if you don't go
				You'll never shine if you don't glow</p>

				<p>[Chorus]
				Hey now, you're an all star
				Get your game on, go play
				Hey now, you're a rock star
				Get the show on, get paid
				And all that glitters is gold
				Only shooting stars break the mold</p>

				<p>[Verse 2]
				It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
				You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
				But the meteor men beg to differ
				Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
				The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
				The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
				My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
				That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored</p>

				<p>[Chorus]
				Hey now, you're an all star
				Get your game on, go play
				Hey now, you're a rock star
				Get the show on, get paid
				All that glitters is gold
				Only shooting stars break the mold</p>

				<p>[Interlude]
				(Go for the moon)
				(Go for the moon)
				(Go for the moon)
				(Go for the moon)</p>

				<p>[Chorus]
				Hey now, you're an all star
				Get your game on, go play
				Hey now, you're a rock star
				Get the show on, get paid
				And all that glitters is gold
				Only shooting stars</p>

				<p>[Verse 3]
				Somebody once asked
				Could I spare some change for gas?
				"I need to get myself away from this place"
				I said, "Yep, what a concept
				I could use a little fuel myself
				And we could all use a little change"</p>

				<p>[Pre-Chorus]
				Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
				Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
				Didn't make sense not to live for fun
				Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
				So much to do, so much to see
				So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
				You'll never know if you don't go
				You'll never shine if you don't glow</p>

				<p>[Chorus]
				Hey now, you're an all star
				Get your game on, go play
				Hey now, you're a rock star
				Get the show on, get paid
				And all that glitters is gold
				Only shooting stars break the mold
				And all that glitters is gold
				Only shooting stars break the mold</p>
